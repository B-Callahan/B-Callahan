Hey everyone!

My name is B-Callahan and I'm a student studying software engineering. I'm also a student worker front-end developer in which I manage 300+ pages within a Wordpress Multisite for the university I attend.
My favorite programming languages are C, Python, and PHP. I normally focus on web development along with mathmatical programming and handling/sorting data. I'm also pretty handy in creating responsive maps using QGIS.
I also love video games - because of my passion for video games and coding I've recently gotten into VR game development using Unity. You can check out my gaming instagram here for some cool videos: https://www.instagram.com/sloppy_puhh/
